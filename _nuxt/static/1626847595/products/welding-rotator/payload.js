This can help you get better welding quality. It can be used alone to weld long straight seams. The welding manipulator can be used in combination with the welding roller frame for circular seam welding. Either way, upgrading the welding manipulator or investing in a complete welding manipulator system can quickly recover costs by increasing productivity and improving quality.\r\nWhen purchasing a standard column and boom welding manipulator, it is important to first have a thorough understanding of all possible welding production. These factors will determine which options are best for your welding equipment.\r\nWhen welding pipes, the following points need to be considered:\r\nDoes the welding manipulator need to be moved? Is he required to be able to weld long straight seams and circular seams? Does the base need to be rotated to handle multiple welding stations?\r\nWill the long straight seam of the pipeline be longer than the stroke of the welding manipulator? In this case, it is necessary to install the welding trolley and the guide rail device on the base of the welding manipulator. In this way, the welding manipulator can move along the pipeline on the guide rail, and the long straight seam outside the pipeline can be welded smoothly at a constant speed.\r\nFor welding inside long straight seams, does the manipulator need to be long enough to extend the pipe? This requires that the robotic arm of the welding manipulator is long enough and can control the travel speed of the robotic arm. Please make sure you have a variable frequency drive (VFD). Of course, linear bearings are also a good choice to ensure smooth movement and repeated positioning of the welding head.\r\nIs it required to install a flux recovery device? Is it necessary to add a loading device? If so, then you need to consider the load capacity of the robotic arm.\r\nAfter choosing a welding manipulator, a fully functional welding kit will also provide other options."}]}]},dir:"\u002Fen\u002Fproducts\u002Fwelding-rotator",path:"\u002Fen\u002Fproducts\u002Fwelding-rotator\u002Findex",extension:".md",createdAt:"2021-07-16T14:26:32.598Z",updatedAt:"2021-07-16T14:48:49.802Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0});
