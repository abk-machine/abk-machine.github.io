The welding manipulator is used in the longitudinal seam welding and girth seam welding of the inner and outer seams of cylindrical workpieces such as boiler drums and petrochemical vessels in pressure vessels.\r\nThe welding manipulator can be combined with the welding roller frame, welding positioner, etc., special equipment for automatic welding of the inner and outer circumferential seams, fillet welds, and inner and outer longitudinal seams of the workpiece. Welding manipulators have a variety of structural forms such as fixed, rotary, and all positions. The structure can be selected according to the needs of users, the matching welding machine, and auxiliary functions such as tracking, swing, monitoring, and flux recovery and transportation can be added.\r\nThe welding manipulator is mainly composed of an operating device, a control device, a power source device, and a process support device. The operating device includes a guide rail, an inclination angle adjustment mechanism, a vertical guide mechanism, a welding gun clamp, and a welding gun. The inclination angle adjustment mechanism enables the welding gun to rotate q around the center. The control device is composed of an electrical control system, which can control the working state of the welding manipulator. The power source device is composed of air cylinders, which are driven by air pressure for power transmission. The process guarantee device is composed of a wire guide mechanism, a wire guide tube, and a wire guide nozzle, which can realize the automatic guiding and positioning of the welding wire and guarantee the quality of the weld."}]}]},dir:"\u002Fen\u002Farticles",path:"\u002Fen\u002Farticles\u002Fstructure-welding-manipulator",extension:".md",createdAt:"2021-07-12T06:51:06.745Z",updatedAt:"2021-07-12T06:52:32.635Z"},prev:{slug:"choose-welding-manipulator",description:"The welding manipulator can choose a variety of welding processes, such as MIG welding, TIG welding, and submerged arc welding.
