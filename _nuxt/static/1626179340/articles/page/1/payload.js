The welding manipulator can be used in combination with the welding roller frame for circular seam welding. Either way, upgrading the welding manipulator or investing in a complete welding manipulator system can quickly recover costs by increasing productivity and improving quality.\r\nWhen purchasing a standard column and boom welding manipulator, it is important to first have a thorough understanding of all possible welding production. These factors will determine which options are best for your welding equipment.\r\nWhen welding pipes, the following points need to be considered:\r\nDoes the welding manipulator need to be moved? Is he required to be able to weld long straight seams and circular seams? Does the base need to be rotated to handle multiple welding stations?\r\nWill the long straight seam of the pipeline be longer than the stroke of the welding manipulator? In this case, it is necessary to install the welding trolley and the guide rail device on the base of the welding manipulator. In this way, the welding manipulator can move along the pipeline on the guide rail, and the long straight seam outside the pipeline can be welded smoothly at a constant speed.\r\nFor welding inside long straight seams, does the manipulator need to be long enough to extend the pipe? This requires that the robotic arm of the welding manipulator is long enough and can control the travel speed of the robotic arm. Please make sure you have a variable frequency drive (VFD). Of course, linear bearings are also a good choice to ensure smooth movement and repeated positioning of the welding head.\r\nIs it required to install a flux recovery device? Is it necessary to add a loading device? If so, then you need to consider the load capacity of the robotic arm.\r\nAfter choosing a welding manipulator, a fully functional welding kit will also provide other options."}]}]},dir:g,path:"\u002Fen\u002Farticles\u002Fchoose-welding-manipulator",extension:h,createdAt:"2021-07-12T06:49:12.201Z",updatedAt:"2021-07-12T06:50:03.359Z"},{slug:v,description:w,title:x,category:y,image:"https:\u002F\u002Fthebestcnc.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2021\u002F02\u002FWhy-does-the-CNC-plasma-cutting-machine-break-the-arc-when-cutting.jpg",author:{name:t,image:u},toc:[{id:z,depth:i,text:A},{id:B,depth:i,text:C},{id:D,depth:i,text:E}],body:{type:f,children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:w}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:j,props:{id:z},children:[{type:b,tag:k,props:{ariaHidden:l,href:"#the-air-pressure-is-not-stable-enough",tabIndex:m},children:[{type:b,tag:n,props:{className:[o,p]},children:[]}]},{type:a,value:A}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"The working pressure of plasma cutting is too high or too low will affect the cutting effect.

Therefore, a welding positioner is needed at this time.\r\nWhen the welding robot cannot perform welding along the set path. To ensure welding quality and improve production efficiency, it is often necessary to adjust the welding seam to the best position such as horizontal and vertical for welding. Therefore, it is necessary to change the position of the welding workpiece promptly. This is the reason why almost all welding robots need to be equipped with corresponding welding positioners to perform welding.\r\nWhen selecting the welding positioner matched with the welding robot, the accuracy requirements of the welding positioner are different. Asynchronous coordination requires high positioning accuracy of the welding positioner. In addition to high positioning accuracy, synchronization coordination also requires high trajectory accuracy and movement accuracy. This is the main difference between the robot special welding positioner and the ordinary welding positioner.\r\nGenerally, the positioning accuracy of welding robots is mostly 0.1-1mm.
