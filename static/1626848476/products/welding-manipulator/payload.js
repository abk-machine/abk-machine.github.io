This can help you get better welding quality. It can be used alone to weld long straight seams. The welding manipulator can be used in combination with the welding roller frame for circular seam welding. Either way, upgrading the welding manipulator or investing in a complete welding manipulator system can quickly recover costs by increasing productivity and improving quality.",title:"Welding Rotator",category:"Guide",image:"https:\u002F\u002Fthebestcnc.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2021\u002F01\u002FHow-to-choose-a-welding-manipulator.jpg",toc:[{id:c,depth:2,text:d}],body:{type:"root",children:[{type:a,tag:"h2",props:{id:c},children:[{type:a,tag:"a",props:{ariaHidden:"true",href:"#description-of-standard-welding-rotator",tabIndex:-1},children:[{type:a,tag:"span",props:{className:["icon","icon-link"]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:d}]},{type:b,value:"\n"},{type:a,tag:"p",props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"Our standard welding rotator is mainly used for handling and automatic welding circular metal containers, and can be widely applied to oil industry, press vessel field, wind power production line, pipe line production sector, and many other round workpieces.\r\nOur HGZ-type standard welding rotator is designed and produced to better satisfy the growing demands for the pressure vessel manufacturers both domestically and internationally.
