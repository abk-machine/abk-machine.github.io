title: Why do welding robots need welding positioners?
category: News & Updates
description: The welding robot has 5-6 degrees of freedom and can reach any welding point within the operating range in practical applications. This can meet the requirements of the welding workpiece in the welding process. However, for some weldments with complex structures, if they are not changed in time, the ideal welding effect may not be achieved. Therefore, a welding positioner is needed at this time.

The welding robot has 5-6 degrees of freedom and can reach any welding point within the operating range in practical applications. This can meet the requirements of the welding workpiece in the welding process. However, for some weldments with complex structures, if they are not changed in time, the ideal welding effect may not be achieved. Therefore, a welding positioner is needed at this time.
When the welding robot cannot perform welding along the set path. To ensure welding quality and improve production efficiency, it is often necessary to adjust the welding seam to the best position such as horizontal and vertical for welding. Therefore, it is necessary to change the position of the welding workpiece promptly. This is the reason why almost all welding robots need to be equipped with corresponding welding positioners to perform welding.
When selecting the welding positioner matched with the welding robot, the accuracy requirements of the welding positioner are different. Asynchronous coordination requires high positioning accuracy of the welding positioner. In addition to high positioning accuracy, synchronization coordination also requires high trajectory accuracy and movement accuracy. This is the main difference between the robot special welding positioner and the ordinary welding positioner.
Generally, the positioning accuracy of welding robots is mostly 0.1-1mm. Therefore, the positioning accuracy of the welding positioner should also be within this range. The larger the welding workpiece, the farther the welding seam is from the center of rotation or tilting, the higher the corner accuracy of the welding positioner is required.

## What will affect the accuracy of the welding positioner?

After a long-term research, it is concluded that when the workbench is at different inclination angles, unilateral factors such as rotation angle, rotation speed, and load resistance torque, or a combination of multiple factors, will actually affect The accuracy of the worktable in the rotary motion of the welding positioner. Finally, the following factors that will affect the accuracy of the welding positioner in motion are obtained.
Research has found that the rotation speed, rotation angle, and tilt angle of the welding positioner worktable will affect the accuracy of the welding positioner.
