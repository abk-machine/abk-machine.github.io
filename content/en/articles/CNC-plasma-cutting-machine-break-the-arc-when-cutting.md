CNC plasma cutting machine has the advantages of simple operation, high cutting precision, high work efficiency, and low labor intensity. It is very popular in cutting a variety of metals and small size workpieces. However, for users who are exposed to CNC plasma cutting machines for the first time, arc breaking has become a common and headache problem, to help everyone solve this problem. Huafei CNC summarized the reasons and solutions for the arc breaking of CNC plasma cutting machine, hoping to help users operate.

## The air pressure is not stable enough

The working pressure of plasma cutting is too high or too low will affect the cutting effect. If the working pressure is far below the required pressure. This will cause the discharge speed of the plasma arc to decrease, and the input air flow rate is less than the specified value. Can not form high-energy, high-speed plasma arc. Causes poor incision quality, impenetrable incision, and incision tumor. If the input air pressure exceeds 0.45MPa, the working air pressure is too high. After the ion arc is formed, the excessive airflow will blow away the concentrated arc column, disperse the arc column energy, and weaken the cutting strength of the plasma arc.

## Burning torch nozzle and electrode

Because of the improper installation of the nozzle, the CNC plasma cutting machine broke the arc. For example, if the thread is not tightened, the gears of the equipment are not adjusted properly, the cutting torch that requires water cooling is working, the cooling water is not passed as required, and the frequent arcing will cause premature damage to the nozzle.
Solution: Correctly adjust the gears of the equipment according to the technical requirements of cutting the workpiece. Check whether the torch nozzle is installed firmly. Need to connect the cooling water nozzle to make the cooling water circulate. When cutting, adjust the distance between the cutting torch and the workpiece according to the thickness of the workpiece.

## Input AC voltage is too low

There are large-scale electrical facilities at the use site of the CNC plasma cutting machine, and the failure of the internal main circuit components of the cutting machine will cause the input AC voltage to be too low and cause the arc to break.
Solution: Check whether the power grid connected to the CNC plasma cutting machine has sufficient carrying capacity. Whether the power cord specifications meet the requirements. The installation location of the CNC plasma cutting machine should be far away from large-scale electrical equipment and places with frequent electrical interference. During use, clean the dust in the cutting machine and the dirt on the components regularly, and check whether the wires are aging.
