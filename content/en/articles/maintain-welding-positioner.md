In recent years, welding positioners have developed rapidly in the construction machinery industry and have been widely used. Has quietly become indispensable machine equipment in the manufacturing industry. Today, the welding positioner manufacturer Huafei CNC is here to explain the daily maintenance precautions of the welding positioner.
The daily maintenance of the welding positioner is divided into the maintenance of welding chuck and maintenance of welding positioner machine.

## Maintenance of welding chuck

The welding chuck is an important part of the automatic welding positioner, which needs frequent maintenance and maintenance. When special circumstances occur, the frequency of welding maintenance must be increased. This can greatly extend the service life of the welding chuck and improve the work and production efficiency. The correct maintenance method of the welding chuck is as follows.
1. After the chuck is used, the body of the welding chuck and the surface of the slideway must be cleaned with an air gun and other tools, so as to ensure that the welding chuck still has good accuracy after long-term use, so regular lubrication of the welding chuck Work is very important.
2. Apply molybdenum disulfide grease (black in color) at least once a day, and drive the grease into the welding chuck nozzle until the grease overflows the jaw surface or the inner hole of the welding chuck (the inner hole protective sleeve and the connecting nut).
3. In order to prevent rust inside the welding chuck, the holding force is reduced and the workpiece cannot be clamped, so it is better to use cutting oil with an anti-rust effect. Using cutting oil can prevent rust inside the welding chuck.
4. Air gun or similar tools must be used to clean the welding chuck body and slideway surface when the operation is completed.
5. The welding chuck should be removed and cleaned at least every 6 months to keep the sliding surface of the jaws clean and lubricated to increase the life of the welding chuck.
6. Check all parts for cracks and wear, cut cast iron at least once every 2 months to clean them thoroughly, and replace them with new ones if they are severely damaged.
7. Different clamping methods must be used for different workpieces. If it is used to clamp irregular workpieces, the welding chuck will be damaged.
8. When the welding chuck pressure is abnormal, make the welding chuck under high pressure to clamp the workpiece, which will reduce the service life of the welding chuck. Therefore, when the welding chuck gap is found to be too large, a new welding chuck must be replaced immediately.
