title: What is the structure of the welding manipulator?
category: Guide
description: The welding manipulator is generally composed of columns, beams, slewing mechanisms, trolleys, and other components. Each component is a building block structure. Generally, columns and beams are basic components, and other components can be selected according to requirements. Columns and beams adopt bending and welding structural parts, which have good rigidity. The light, medium, and heavy-duty welding manipulators all use triangular guide rails, and the super heavy-duty uses flat square guide rails, which are all processed by a planer to ensure the high precision and wear resistance of the guide rails. The welding manipulator is used in the longitudinal seam welding and girth seam welding of the inner and outer seams of cylindrical workpieces such as boiler drums and petrochemical vessels in pressure vessels.

The welding manipulator is generally composed of columns, beams, slewing mechanisms, trolleys, and other components. Each component is a building block structure. Generally, columns and beams are basic components, and other components can be selected according to requirements. Columns and beams adopt bending and welding structural parts, which have good rigidity. The light, medium, and heavy-duty welding manipulators all use triangular guide rails, and the super heavy-duty uses flat square guide rails, which are all processed by a planer to ensure the high precision and wear resistance of the guide rails. The welding manipulator is used in the longitudinal seam welding and girth seam welding of the inner and outer seams of cylindrical workpieces such as boiler drums and petrochemical vessels in pressure vessels.
The welding manipulator can be combined with the welding roller frame, welding positioner, etc., special equipment for automatic welding of the inner and outer circumferential seams, fillet welds, and inner and outer longitudinal seams of the workpiece. Welding manipulators have a variety of structural forms such as fixed, rotary, and all positions. The structure can be selected according to the needs of users, the matching welding machine, and auxiliary functions such as tracking, swing, monitoring, and flux recovery and transportation can be added.
The welding manipulator is mainly composed of an operating device, a control device, a power source device, and a process support device. The operating device includes a guide rail, an inclination angle adjustment mechanism, a vertical guide mechanism, a welding gun clamp, and a welding gun. The inclination angle adjustment mechanism enables the welding gun to rotate q around the center. The control device is composed of an electrical control system, which can control the working state of the welding manipulator. The power source device is composed of air cylinders, which are driven by air pressure for power transmission. The process guarantee device is composed of a wire guide mechanism, a wire guide tube, and a wire guide nozzle, which can realize the automatic guiding and positioning of the welding wire and guarantee the quality of the weld.
