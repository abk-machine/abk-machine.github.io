description: The welding rotator can choose a variety of welding processes, such as MIG welding, TIG welding, and submerged arc welding. This can help you get better welding quality. It can be used alone to weld long straight seams. The welding manipulator can be used in combination with the welding roller frame for circular seam welding. Either way, upgrading the welding manipulator or investing in a complete welding manipulator system can quickly recover costs by increasing productivity and improving quality.
